## Visiting TMI clubs in District 107 Division B
##### (Barcelona and surroundings clubs)

Hi I’m Maximo and have been a member of Toastmasters International for almost 9 years in Argentina. Since I came to live in Barcelona I have had the desire to have a look at the clubs here and I came across some surprises.
At the moment I’m writing this blog as part of the project “Write a Compelling Blog” from Visionary Communicator pathway level 4. That’s why I have a great idea: Visit most of the clubs in Barcelona and review them so you can decide which of them to join.
