### Mediterranea TM

Their meetings are held in “Parc de Recerca Biomedica de Barcelona”. It’s a bit tricky to get there as you have to cross the lobby and exit again to the central part of the building. The sessions are in Spanish and in English alternated. 

When I visited them, the meeting started on time at 7.45 PM. The time of the meeting usually changes as it depends on room availability. There were 9 guests and the TTP was at the end.
The prepared speeches were 2. The first one talked about the importance of time and why we should focus on the present. The second one, made a strong point on why we should stop complaining and start finding solutions. It is worth mentioning that she spoke the whole speech with a sweet in her mouth, something I never saw in 9 years of Toastmasters!

At the end of the session, Yan the president encouraged the members to participate in TTP as the TTP was long and everyone had the opportunity to reach the stage.
The meeting theme was Leadership.

WOD: Carisma
