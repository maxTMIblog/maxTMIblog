### Prestigious Speakers Club 

Their meetings are held in “Centro Aragones de Sarriá”. The meetings start at 7.45 PM on time most of the time if they don’t have any issues with the computer as they have hybrid sessions every time.

When I joined for the first time there were 3 speakers where 2 of them were icebreakers. The whole meeting and the club is English only and some of its members are English native. There were 6 guests where some of them were English native too.
The Table topic is at the beginning not as most of the clubs in the division.

About the prepared speeches, the first speaker talked about who she is and how she deals with nervousness. The second one gave his first speech with a powerful closing message. And the last one, delivered a lesson about evaluation and feedback.
Lastly the general evaluator was eloquent and funny at the same time.
