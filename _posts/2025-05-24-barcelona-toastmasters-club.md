### Barcelona Toastmasters Club

The BCN Toastmasters Club is since 2003 one of the oldest clubs in the division. They meet in the CREC coworking space every Wednesday at 7.30 pm. They alternate each Wednesday between Spanish and English meetings.

When I visited them, the meeting was in English. It started on time despite not having the agenda delivered. There was only one guest.
About the Speakers: The first speaker delivered his icebreaker talking about how he got out of his comfort zone and simultaneously found his freedom. The second speaker project was “Managing a tough audience”. The topic was about splinters, ancient monuments and aliens but that was not important about this speech. What really matters here is how the speaker overcame all the interruptions, intrepid questions and noises while he kept the audience engaged. It was interesting and fun, a project strangely seen.

At the end, there was a round of table topics about the blackout that had happened two days before. Then the GE evaluated the whole meeting with a lot of charisma, attitude and in a timely manner. Finally, the president encouraged the members to join easy-speak so they are able to vote for the next executive committee roles and closed the meeting.
After the meeting they do a post-toast at a next door bar.
