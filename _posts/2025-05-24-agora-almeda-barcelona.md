### Agora Almeda Barcelona

Online club with meetings both in Spanish and English sometimes at the same time. They meet between 1 PM and 2 PM on Thursdays on Zoom.
Itâ€™s the home club of the area director and one of its members is the 2020 Spanish district contest winner.

The meeting I attended was short but efficient. One of the speakers delivered a speech in Catalan and the TTP was appropriate for the duration of the session.
