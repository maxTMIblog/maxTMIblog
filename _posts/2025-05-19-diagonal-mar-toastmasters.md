### Diagonal Mar Toastmasters

This club meets in an office building near the shopping Diagonal Mar. They meet the second and the fourth Thursday of each month at 7 PM.
When I participated there were many guests around 7. The meeting was a bit delayed, around 7 minutes because it was their club contest that day in particular.
The two contestants both gave their speech in English. The first one was based on human intelligence. The second one spoke about how to become a fully Spanien even after living half of his life in Spain.
Finally, the winner was the second speaker who participated in the March 8th area contest.
