### Sagrada Familia Toastmasters Club

The club met in Spanish the time I went but they alternate between meetings. Also, the meetings are hybrid even though the experience is not the same as there’s too much echo. The room is located in Fundació Festa Major de Gracia.

The meeting started 5 minutes late due to computer problems but it usually starts at 7.30 PM every first, third and fifth Monday.

There were two speakers, the first one gave a competition purpose speech in Portuguese. The second was a competition speech too in Spanish but the speaker is a native english speaker so it was a challenge for him.

Meeting them: Carnaval

Rethoric: Paradox

WOD: Consuetudinario
